Interactive, menu-driven terminal UI to inspect and manage Typesense collections with SearchEngine models.

### Launch

```bash
bundle exec tuit
```

TUIT auto-loads your Rails app and host <code>app/search_engine</code> models to resolve logical collections.

### Main menu

- Collections
- API Keys
- Settings
- Quit

### Collections

- Lists resolved collections as <code>SearchEngine::Model (logical)</code> with total document count.
- Unresolved physical collections appear as raw names.

Selecting a resolved collection shows:

- Physical collections: lists all matching physical collections for the logical alias
- Drop collection: drops active physical and alias
- (Re)Index: full reindex (shown when not partitioned)
- (Re)Index full collection / (Re)Index partition: partitioned workflows
- Back: returns one level up

Selecting an unresolved physical collection shows:

- View schema
- Drop physical collection
- Back

Navigation rule: Back always goes one level up. After dropping a collection (logical or physical), the parent menu refreshes immediately.

### Partition input

- Single value or comma-separated list (numeric parsed as integers, others as strings), e.g. <code>42</code> or <code>foo,bar,42</code>.

### Tips

- If a model doesn’t appear resolved, ensure it inherits from <code>SearchEngine::Base</code> and defines <code>collection 'logical'</code>.
- TUIT prefers alias target first but lists all physicals that normalize to the logical name.

### Safety

- Drop actions require confirmation.
